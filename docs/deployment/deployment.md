# BudgetApp — Installation Guide

**Also available in:** [Français](deployment.fr-CA.md)

> **Who this is for:** Unraid users comfortable with the Terminal and Community Applications. No programming knowledge required.

---

## What You'll Need Before Starting

- **Unraid 6.12 or newer**
- **Nginx Proxy Manager** installed from Community Applications (for access outside your home network)
- A domain name pointed at your home IP, or a local hostname like `budget.lan`

---

## 1. Install BudgetApp

Open an Unraid Terminal and run these three commands:

```bash
git clone <repository-url> /mnt/user/repos/BudgetApp
cd /mnt/user/repos/BudgetApp
./scripts/setup/setup-prod.sh
```

The setup script will ask for your domain name, then do everything else automatically — generating your security keys, creating all the necessary folders, and starting the app.

When it finishes, BudgetApp will be running on port **3000**.

> **Optional:** Pass your domain name directly to skip the prompt:
> ```bash
> ./scripts/setup/setup-prod.sh --domain budget.yourdomain.com
> ```

---

## 2. Save Your Master Secret

The first time you open BudgetApp in a browser, you will see a screen asking you to save your **Master Secret** before you can create an account.

**This is the single most important step.** Your Master Secret is a long string of letters and numbers that protects all of your data. If you ever need to move BudgetApp to a new server, this is what you'll need to restore it.

1. Click **Copy** to copy the Master Secret to your clipboard.
2. Paste it into a password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.) or write it down and store it somewhere safe.
3. Check the confirmation box and click **Continue** to proceed to account creation.

Once you dismiss this screen, the secret will never be shown again.

## 3. Set Up Nginx Proxy Manager (for external access)

If you want to access BudgetApp from outside your home network with a real domain name and HTTPS, configure a Proxy Host in Nginx Proxy Manager:

1. Open Nginx Proxy Manager and go to **Proxy Hosts → Add Proxy Host**.
2. Fill in the **Details** tab:
   - **Domain Names:** `budget.yourdomain.com`
   - **Forward Hostname / IP:** the IP address of your Unraid server
   - **Forward Port:** `3000`
   - Turn on **Websockets Support**
3. On the **SSL** tab:
   - Select **Request a new SSL Certificate**
   - Turn on **Force SSL**
4. On the **Advanced** tab, paste this into the custom Nginx configuration box:

```nginx
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
```

5. Click **Save**.

BudgetApp is now accessible at `https://budget.yourdomain.com`.

## 4. Backup

BudgetApp stores all of its data in two places. Back up both regularly.

| What | Where on your Unraid server |
|------|-----------------------------|
| All app data (database, sessions, uploads) | `/mnt/user/appdata/budget-app/` |
| Master Secret | `secrets/production/master_secret.txt` (inside the BudgetApp repo folder) |

**The Master Secret file is tiny but critical.** Copy it somewhere off-server (a password manager, an encrypted USB drive, a second location). You can rebuild everything else from it.

For the app data folder, use Unraid's built-in backup tools or the **CA Backup / Restore** plugin to schedule regular copies to a share or external drive.

---

## 5. Upgrade

```bash
cd /mnt/user/repos/BudgetApp
git pull
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml down
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

Any database updates are applied automatically when the app starts back up.

---

## 6. Restore / Disaster Recovery

### Moving to a new server (or rebuilding after a failure)

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose on the new server.
2. Clone the BudgetApp repository to the same path.
3. Copy your backed-up `/mnt/user/appdata/budget-app/` folder to the new server.
4. Restore your security keys from your Master Secret:

```bash
cd /mnt/user/repos/BudgetApp
./scripts/setup/derive-secrets.sh YOUR-MASTER-SECRET-HERE
```

5. Start the app:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

Your data and settings will be exactly as you left them.

---

## Troubleshooting

### The app won't start

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml logs
```

Check the output for error messages. Common causes:

- **Missing secret files** — run `./scripts/setup/setup-prod.sh` again from the repo folder.
- **Port 3000 already in use** — another container is using that port. Change the port by editing `FRONTEND_PORT` in `secrets/production/.env`, then restart.

### The app starts but I can't log in / WebAuthn errors

Make sure your domain name in Nginx Proxy Manager exactly matches the domain you used during setup. Mismatched hostnames will prevent passkey and security features from working.

### Check whether the app is running

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

All four services (`budget_frontend`, `budget_backend`, `budget_mariadb`, `budget_redis`) should show **Up**.

### SSL certificate problems

SSL is managed entirely by Nginx Proxy Manager. If you're seeing certificate errors, check the certificate status in NPM's admin panel. Make sure the proxy host is forwarding to `http://` (not `https://`) — NPM handles the secure connection on its side.
