## Bugs Found and Fixed During Review

### 1. CRITICAL: `configureApiClient` never called
**Impact:** All API requests sent without Authorization header; access token never stored after silent refresh → infinite refresh loop potential.
**Fix:** Added `setAccessToken` parameter to `configureApiClient`; called from `AppProviders.tsx` using `useAuthStore.getState()` (avoids React hook rules and circular imports).

### 2. TIMING ATTACK: Invalid dummy Argon2id hash
**Impact:** `DUMMY_HASH` was a fake format string; `argon2.verify()` throws immediately (~0ms) instead of running the full Argon2id computation (~200–500ms). Timing difference could reveal whether an email is registered.
**Fix:** `DUMMY_HASH` is now computed as a real `argon2.hash(randomBytes(32))` at module startup — a valid hash that exercises the full verification path.

### 3. RACE CONDITION: `useAuth.ts` token dependency
**Impact:** `if (data && accessToken)` used React-subscribed `accessToken`. If `data` and the token arrived in different renders, `setAuth` might not fire (leaving `isAuthenticated: false`).
**Fix:** Read `accessToken` synchronously via `useAuthStore.getState()` inside the effect — guaranteed to reflect the current value at the time `data` is available.

### 4. CODE DUPLICATION: `getErrorMessage` in 6 components
**Impact:** Maintenance burden; inconsistent fallback messages.
**Fix:** Extracted to `lib/api/errors.ts` as `getApiErrorMessage`; replaced all 6 call sites.

## Security Checklist (Final)

| Control | Status |
|---------|--------|
| User enumeration prevention (dummy Argon2 verify) | ✅ |
| Refresh token reuse → kill all sessions | ✅ |
| 2FA type guards on middleware | ✅ |
| WebAuthn challenge deleted immediately after verify | ✅ |
| Backup code `timingSafeEqual` comparison | ✅ |
| Cookie: httpOnly, Strict, scoped to `/api/v1/auth` | ✅ |
| Account lockout checked before password verify | ✅ |
| TOTP secret not persisted until confirmSetup | ✅ |
| Access token in memory only (never localStorage) | ✅ |
| Refresh token: only hash stored in DB | ✅ |
| Public key bytes stripped from passkey list response | ✅ |
| configureApiClient wired (token attaches to requests) | ✅ |
| Real dummy hash (full Argon2 timing) | ✅ |

## Dependency Fix Applied Post-Review

Two devDependencies were missing from `frontend/package.json` and were added:
- `jsdom` — required by Vitest as a peer dependency when `environment: 'jsdom'` is configured; frontend tests could not run without it.
- `@vitest/coverage-v8@2.1.9` — required for the `provider: 'v8'` coverage setting; version must match the installed Vitest version.

---

## Known Limitations / Phase 3+ Work

- `rate-limit-redis` not installed — rate limiter uses in-memory store. Acceptable for single-process self-hosted deployment; add before multi-process scaling.
- Email verification flow not implemented (the `emailVerified` flag is stored but no verification email is sent) — punted to a future phase.
- No WebAuthn discoverable credential (usernameless) flow — current implementation always requires a `challengeToken` from the options endpoint.
